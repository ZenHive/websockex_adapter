# WebsockexAdapter Task List

## Development Status Update (December 2024)
### ✅ Recently Completed
- **Phase 5 Complete**: Critical financial infrastructure tasks (WNX0019, WNX0020, WNX0023) moved to archive
- **Foundation + Enhancements**: 8 core modules + 3 critical infrastructure modules operational
- **Production Ready**: Financial-grade reliability with real API testing achieved

### 🚀 Next Up
- **WNX0026**: Prepare for Hex.pm Publishing - Make the library available to the Elixir community

### 📊 Progress: 1 active task - Preparing for public release!

## WebSocket Client Architecture
WebsockexAdapter is a production-grade WebSocket client for financial trading systems. Built on Gun transport with 8 foundation modules for core functionality, now enhanced with critical financial infrastructure while maintaining strict quality constraints per module.

## Integration Test Setup Notes
- All tests use real WebSocket APIs (test.deribit.com)
- No mocks for WebSocket responses  
- Verify end-to-end functionality across component boundaries
- Test behavior under realistic conditions (network latency, connection drops)

## Simplicity Guidelines for All Tasks
- Maximum 5 functions per module
- Maximum 15 lines per function
- No behaviors unless ≥3 concrete implementations exist
- Direct Gun API usage - no wrapper layers
- Functions over processes - GenServers only when essential
- Real API testing only - zero mocks

---

### WNX0027.1: Implement RateLimitedClient Example
**Description**: Create working implementation and tests for the RateLimitedClient example shown in docs/Examples.md (line 154).

**Simplicity Principle**: Minimal wrapper showing how to integrate rate limiting with WebSocket operations.

**Requirements**:
- Create `lib/websockex_adapter/examples/rate_limited_client.ex`
- Implement `send_order/3` function as shown in documentation
- Maximum 3-4 functions demonstrating rate-limited operations
- Create comprehensive tests in `test/websockex_adapter/examples/rate_limited_client_test.exs`

**Test Scenarios**:
- Test successful order when under rate limit
- Test rate limit rejection when over limit
- Test batch operations with mixed success/rejection
- Integration test with real WebSocket connection

**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: High
**Estimated LOC**: ~50 lines

---

### WNX0027.2: Implement MyTradingSystem Example
**Description**: Create working implementation for the MyTradingSystem advanced Deribit features example (line 273).

**Simplicity Principle**: Show advanced Deribit features without creating a full trading system.

**Requirements**:
- Create `lib/websockex_adapter/examples/my_trading_system.ex`
- Implement `setup_risk_management/1` and `get_market_state/2` functions

**Status**: Planned  
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated LOC**: ~80 lines

---

### WNX0027.3: Implement DeribitMarketDataHandler Example
**Description**: Create the high-frequency market data handler GenServer example (line 351).

**Simplicity Principle**: Focus on buffering and batch processing patterns, not full trading logic.

---

### WNX0027.5: Implement BatchSubscriptionManager Example
**Description**: Create example showing how to batch subscriptions to avoid overwhelming Deribit's API with too many simultaneous subscription requests.

**Simplicity Principle**: Simple GenServer that queues and batches subscription requests with configurable batch size and delay.

**Requirements**:
- Create `lib/websockex_adapter/examples/batch_subscription_manager.ex`
- Implement subscription batching with configurable batch size (e.g., 10 channels at a time)
- Add delay between batches to respect API limits
- Show progress tracking and error handling
- Create tests verifying batching behavior

**Implementation Details**:
- Maximum batch size: 10 channels (Deribit recommendation)
- Delay between batches: 100-500ms
- Queue subscriptions and process in FIFO order
- Handle partial batch failures gracefully
- Provide subscription status feedback

**Test Scenarios**:
- Test batching of 50+ subscriptions into chunks of 10
- Test delay between batch submissions
- Test handling of subscription failures in a batch
- Test subscription queue management
- Integration test with real Deribit API

**Example Usage**:
```elixir
# Instead of subscribing to 50 channels at once
{:ok, manager} = BatchSubscriptionManager.start_link(
  adapter: deribit_adapter,
  batch_size: 10,
  batch_delay: 200
)

# Queue all subscriptions - they'll be sent in batches
channels = for i <- 1..50, do: "book.BTC-#{i}JUN25.raw"
{:ok, request_id} = BatchSubscriptionManager.subscribe_batch(manager, channels)

# Check progress
{:ok, %{completed: 30, pending: 20, failed: 0}} = 
  BatchSubscriptionManager.get_status(manager, request_id)
```

**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: High
**Estimated LOC**: ~120 lines

---

**Implementation Order**:
1. **WNX0027.5** - BatchSubscriptionManager (critical for production use)
2. **WNX0027.1** - RateLimitedClient (simplest, most reusable)
3. **WNX0027.2** - MyTradingSystem (builds on Deribit adapter)
4. **WNX0027.3** - DeribitMarketDataHandler (most complex GenServer)
5. **WNX0027.4** - DeribitTelemetryAdapter (optional enhancement)

## Task Details

### WNX0026: Prepare for Hex.pm Publishing
**Description**: Prepare WebsockexAdapter for publishing to Hex.pm as a production-ready package. Ensure all necessary documentation, metadata, and quality checks are in place for a successful package release.

**Simplicity Progression Plan**:
1. Create essential documentation files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
2. Update package metadata in mix.exs
3. Ensure all dependencies are appropriate for production
4. Verify documentation generation and quality

**Simplicity Principle**:
Keep documentation focused and practical. Provide clear examples without overwhelming new users.

**Abstraction Evaluation**:
- **Challenge**: What documentation is absolutely necessary for users to get started?
- **Minimal Solution**: README with quick start, basic examples, and link to detailed docs
- **Justification**:
  1. Users need to understand what the package does immediately
  2. Users need a working example within 2 minutes
  3. Users need to know where to find advanced documentation

**Requirements**:
- Create comprehensive README.md with installation, quick start, and examples
- Create CHANGELOG.md documenting version history and changes
- Review and update package metadata in mix.exs
- Ensure LICENSE file is present and correct
- Verify all production dependencies are properly specified
- Remove or properly categorize development-only dependencies
- Ensure documentation can be generated without errors
- Add package badges (version, downloads, documentation)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Clear package description explaining WebSocket client capabilities
- Installation instructions with hex dependency snippet
- Quick start example showing basic connection and message handling
- Link to full documentation on HexDocs

**Code Quality KPIs**:
- Documentation completeness: 100% of public functions documented
- Test coverage: > 90% with real API testing
- No compiler warnings
- No dialyzer warnings
- All security checks pass

**Dependencies**:
- ex_doc: Documentation generation
- All current production dependencies properly categorized

**Architecture Notes**:
- Package should be immediately usable after installation

- Keep initial complexity low for new users

**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: High

**Implementation Notes**:
- Focus on practical examples that solve real problems
- Highlight the simplicity and reliability of the architecture
- Show how to extend for other platforms beyond Deribit
- Emphasize the production-grade testing approach

**Complexity Assessment**:
- Previous: No public package
- Current: Well-documented public package
- Added Complexity: Documentation and examples only
- Justification: Required for hex.pm publishing and user adoption

**Maintenance Impact**:
- README.md must be kept up to date with API changes
- CHANGELOG.md must document all releases
- Examples must be tested to ensure they work
- Version bumps must follow semantic versioning

**Publishing Steps**:
1. Complete all documentation tasks
