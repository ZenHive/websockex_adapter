# WebsockexAdapter Task List

## Development Status Update (December 2024)
### ‚úÖ Recently Completed
- **Phase 5 Complete**: Critical financial infrastructure tasks (WNX0019, WNX0020, WNX0023) moved to archive
- **Foundation + Enhancements**: 8 core modules + 3 critical infrastructure modules operational
- **Production Ready**: Financial-grade reliability with real API testing achieved

### üöÄ Next Up
- **WNX0026**: Prepare for Hex.pm Publishing - Make the library available to the Elixir community

### üìä Progress: 1 active task - Preparing for public release!

## WebSocket Client Architecture
WebsockexAdapter is a production-grade WebSocket client for financial trading systems. Built on Gun transport with 8 foundation modules for core functionality, now enhanced with critical financial infrastructure while maintaining strict quality constraints per module.

## Integration Test Setup Notes
- All tests use real WebSocket APIs (test.deribit.com)
- No mocks for WebSocket responses  
- Verify end-to-end functionality across component boundaries
- Test behavior under realistic conditions (network latency, connection drops)

## Simplicity Guidelines for All Tasks
- Maximum 5 functions per module
- Maximum 15 lines per function
- No behaviors unless ‚â•3 concrete implementations exist
- Direct Gun API usage - no wrapper layers
- Functions over processes - GenServers only when essential
- Real API testing only - zero mocks

**üìÅ Archive Reference**: Full specifications, implementation details, and architectural decisions for all completed tasks are maintained in [`docs/archive/completed_tasks.md`](docs/archive/completed_tasks.md). Foundation tasks (WNX0010-WNX0018) and recent infrastructure tasks (WNX0019, WNX0020, WNX0023) are documented there with complete technical details.

## Task Details

### WNX0026: Prepare for Hex.pm Publishing
**Description**: Prepare WebsockexAdapter for publishing to Hex.pm as a production-ready package. Ensure all necessary documentation, metadata, and quality checks are in place for a successful package release.

**Simplicity Progression Plan**:
1. Create essential documentation files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
2. Update package metadata in mix.exs
3. Ensure all dependencies are appropriate for production
4. Verify documentation generation and quality

**Simplicity Principle**:
Keep documentation focused and practical. Provide clear examples without overwhelming new users.

**Abstraction Evaluation**:
- **Challenge**: What documentation is absolutely necessary for users to get started?
- **Minimal Solution**: README with quick start, basic examples, and link to detailed docs
- **Justification**:
  1. Users need to understand what the package does immediately
  2. Users need a working example within 2 minutes
  3. Users need to know where to find advanced documentation

**Requirements**:
- Create comprehensive README.md with installation, quick start, and examples
- Create CHANGELOG.md documenting version history and changes
- Review and update package metadata in mix.exs
- Ensure LICENSE file is present and correct
- Verify all production dependencies are properly specified
- Remove or properly categorize development-only dependencies
- Ensure documentation can be generated without errors
- Add package badges (version, downloads, documentation)

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Clear package description explaining WebSocket client capabilities
- Installation instructions with hex dependency snippet
- Quick start example showing basic connection and message handling
- Link to full documentation on HexDocs
- Brief explanation of key features (Gun transport, reconnection, etc.)
- Example of Deribit integration
- Contributing guidelines
- License information

**Package Metadata Requirements**:
- Accurate description field
- Proper version following semantic versioning
- Complete package configuration with files, licenses, links
- Maintainers information
- Source repository links

**Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] All tests pass with `mix test`
- [ ] No warnings with `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`
- [ ] Dialyzer passes with `mix dialyzer`
- [ ] Credo passes with `mix credo --strict`
- [ ] Documentation generates with `mix docs`
- [ ] Package builds with `mix hex.build`
- [ ] Dry run publish with `mix hex.publish --dry-run`

**Code Quality KPIs**:
- Documentation completeness: 100% of public functions documented
- Test coverage: > 90% with real API testing
- No compiler warnings
- No dialyzer warnings
- All security checks pass

**Dependencies**:
- ex_doc: Documentation generation
- All current production dependencies properly categorized

**Architecture Notes**:
- Package should be immediately usable after installation
- Examples should demonstrate real-world usage patterns
- Documentation should guide users toward best practices
- Keep initial complexity low for new users

**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: High

**Implementation Notes**:
- Focus on practical examples that solve real problems
- Highlight the simplicity and reliability of the architecture
- Show how to extend for other platforms beyond Deribit
- Emphasize the production-grade testing approach

**Complexity Assessment**:
- Previous: No public package
- Current: Well-documented public package
- Added Complexity: Documentation and examples only
- Justification: Required for hex.pm publishing and user adoption

**Maintenance Impact**:
- README.md must be kept up to date with API changes
- CHANGELOG.md must document all releases
- Examples must be tested to ensure they work
- Version bumps must follow semantic versioning

**Publishing Steps**:
1. Complete all documentation tasks
2. Run full quality check suite
3. Tag release in git with version
4. Publish to hex.pm with `mix hex.publish`
5. Verify package on hex.pm and hexdocs.pm
6. Create GitHub release with changelog
