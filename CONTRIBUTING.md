## Testing Policy

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses real API testing exclusively. We do not use mocks.

- All tests must run against real WebSocket endpoints
- Use `test.deribit.com` for Deribit-specific tests
- For general WebSocket tests, use publicly available echo servers
- If credentials are required, they must be provided via environment variables

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style
- Run `mix format` before committing
- Ensure `mix credo --strict` passes
- All public functions must have `@spec` annotations
- All modules must have `@moduledoc` documentation

## Simplicity Guidelines

This project values simplicity:

- Maximum 5 functions per module
- Maximum 15 lines per function
- No unnecessary abstractions
- Direct Gun API usage (no wrapper layers)
- Use GenServers only when state management is needed

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add an entry to CHANGELOG.md under "Unreleased"
4. Ensure your code follows the simplicity guidelines
5. Submit your pull request with a clear description
